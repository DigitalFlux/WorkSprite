## What's it for?

WorkSprite is an NWJS-based app that groups commonly-used links and functionality into a small, extensible, quick-access menu system.

The need for WorkSprite grew from my own development efforts, as I don't like to navigate the vanilla Windows menu system. And though other systems like Rainmeter are very cool, I wanted a GUI that was able to do more than look pretty and show the metrics of my computer.

This project aims at generalizing that tool.

## So, what features does WorkSprite offer?

- A shortcut-driven quick-access menu that appears where your mouse cursor is. In that menu, you have a number of buttons to launch your most frequently-used apps. Using VueJS and the config files, you can also completely customize the GUI to do whatever you like.
- In addition to the menu buttons, there is an omnibox that exposes an extensible library of commands written in JS. You can add your own functions to this library as well, extending what WorkSprite can do for you.
- A scripting system that allows you to compile simple lists of functions you use in the omnibox, and execute them via a "do" command. Do scripts are, like shards, written and dropped into their folders and called upon when needed.

The system is being built to be as flexible and easily extensible as possible for developers to take advantage of.

## Sweet, how easy is it to use?

WorkSprite is planned to have downloadable builds to be able to just unzip and get on with it, in addition to this repo.

This section will change once I get the MVP features stabilized, but if you think this project has promise and want to suggest something, I'm all ears.
